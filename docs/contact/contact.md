## Title VI 
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act states that "no person in the United States, shall, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.” Environmental Justice is defined by the federal government as, "identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations in the United States."

Under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and the Executive Order on Environmental Justice (#12898), Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) are directed to create a method for ensuring that equity issues are investigated and evaluated in transportation decision-making. There is additional guidance from the Federal Highway Administration’s (FHWA) Environmental Justice recommendations (2017), FHWA’s Title VI and Additional Nondiscrimination requirements (2017), Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Environmental Justice policy guidance (2012), and FTA’s Title VI requirements and guidelines (2012).
