## Title VI 
Planning must be done with the involvement and for the benefit of all the region's residents. DVRPC is guided by federal Title VI and environmental justice mandates, and the Commission strives to not only meet these mandates, but to create an overall transparent, inclusive planning process. As the metropolitan planning organization (MPO) for the nine-county region, DVRPC is committed to making Title VI and environmental justice a part of our planning process, integrated in all our programs and plans, and a guide for our public participation efforts. On the horizon, we see a Delaware Valley with an enhanced quality of life and a healthful environment for all of its residents.

Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act states that "no person in the United States, shall, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance."

DVRPC, as the MPO for the Delaware Valley region, serves as the primary forum where state departments of transportation, transit providers, local agencies, and the public work together to develop local transportation plans and programs that address the region's needs. To meet the requirements of Title VI, the Commission must:

Enhance its analytical capabilities to ensure that the Long-Range Plan and the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) comply with Title VI;
Identify residential, employment, and transportation patterns of low-income and minority populations so that their needs may be identified and addressed, and the benefits and burdens of transportation can be fairly distributed; and
Evaluate and, where necessary, improve the public involvement process to eliminate barriers and engage minority, disabled, elderly, and low-income populations in regional decision-making.
