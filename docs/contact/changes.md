## Submitting Changes
If you find segments on either the LTS or pedestrian network that you think should be changed, feel free to submit them.

The [Bike Network Inventory](https://www.dvrpc.org/webmaps/bikenetworkinventory/) is a way to submit bike lanes, trails, etc..., so you can add them here, and eventually they will be verified and folded into the LTS network, thereby reducing the stress level for that segment (if the facility meets the criteria defined in the LTS section of this documentation). Note that you need an account, contact DVRPC GIS if you don't have one.

The [Pedestrian Portal](https://www2.dvrpc.org/asp/dvrpcwalk/Identity/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=%2Fasp%2Fdvrpcwalk%2Fedit) is a place where you can suggest changes to the pedestrian network.
