## Submitting Changes
If you find segments on either the LTS or pedestrian network that you think should be changed, please submit them to DVRPC. To submit bike facilities, go to 
the [Bike Network Inventory](https://www.dvrpc.org/webmaps/bikenetworkinventory/) and add them; DVRPC staff will then verify these additions and update the LTS network, accordingly. 
Note that adding information to the Bike Network Inventory requires an account; to get an account, please contact [DVRPC GIS.](mailto:mruane@dvrpc.org)

The [Pedestrian Portal](https://www2.dvrpc.org/asp/dvrpcwalk/Identity/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=%2Fasp%2Fdvrpcwalk%2Fedit) is a place where you can suggest changes to the pedestrian network.
