Once a study has been created there are several options that allow the data to be shared or downloaded for use in Excel or GIS:

## Sharing a study
Under 'My Studies', you can toggle a button that says 'Make study public'. Once you turn it on, the text turns into a link that you can open and share with anyone. 
The link has a map, that nobody else can edit, and a table, with the data from the study. 

You can also print the page to PDF from your browser, if you'd like to put it in a report. The process to do so varies by browser.

## Downloading study data
### CSV
Under 'My Studies', there is a button at the bottom of the menu that allows you to download a CSV of all of your studies. 
You can open this file in Excel or any program that can read CSVs, where you can then sort your studies by the number of people connected,
jobs connected, miles of low stress islands, or any other piece of data. 

### GeoJSON
You can download a GeoJSON of any individual study, which will include both the segments you analyzed, as well as the blobs and buffers that are associated with 
that project. You can do that under the 'actions' button on the left side of the My Studies table. 

You can upload the "segments" GeoJSON back into LINK, if desired.
