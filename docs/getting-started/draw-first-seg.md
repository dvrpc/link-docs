title: Draw your first segment
---
If it's your first time using the tool, you might consider drawing one segment, to see how it works.


!!! Question

    Are you interested in getting information for a bike project, or a pedestrian project?
    The tool is in 'bike mode' by default, but you can switch to walk mode using the toggle in LINK's toolbar.
    The step-by-step guide below applies to both bike mode or pedestrian mode.
    
## To draw a single study segment:
- Zoom to your study area.
- Select the Linestring tool. ![linestring](../assets/line.svg){: style="height:20px;width:20px"}
- Click on the map to draw a line representing the proposed bicycle or pedestrian facility improvement. Double-click to finish.
 The line can be along an existing roadway to represent an on-road bicycle facility or drawn between existing roadways to represent an off-road trail. In the Pedestrian tool, lines can be drawn anywhere to represent sidewalks or crosswalks.
- Click the Analyze button.
- In the pop-up window, type a name for your project and click Submit.

After the analysis is complete, the map shows a blue line and a semi-transparent polygon. The line represents the analyzed facility that you drew, 
and the polygon highlights the low-stress areas connected by the proposed facility improvements.

If you made a mistake, you can click on the line and grab the white circles to move the segment, extending it. You can also draw another line, but you should decide if you want your results to be 
combined for both lines, or if you want separate results for each line. Read more in the next section.

To view the results of the analysis, you can open My Studies, where you'll see data about the segment and the low-stress areas it would connect.

If you decide to start a different study entirely, make sure you click Clear, otherwise the lines on the map will be part of your new study as well.

If you want to come back to a study you've already analyzed, you can click View Study under My Studies, under the actions button, and the geometry will be re-loaded, and can be edited and re-run as needed.
