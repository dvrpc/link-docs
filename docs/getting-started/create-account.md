title: Create an account
---

LINK requires that users create an account. The account automatically saves your projects and analyses for future reference and allows you to control how your studies are shared with others. 

You can create a LINK account using an existing Google, Microsoft, or GitHub account or through LINK by entering an email address and password of your choice.

If you use an email to sign up, instead of Google/Microsoft/Github, you'll recieve an email asking you to click a link to verity your account. 
This email will be from link@cloud.dvrpc.org. Click the link when you recieve it, and you'll be able to access the tool.
