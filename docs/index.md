## What is LINK?
[DVRPC LINK](https://cloud.dvrpc.org/webmaps/link) is a web-based tool that helps users understand the potential connectivity benefit of improving or building new bicycle or pedestrian facilities. 
Users can draw or upload locations of potential bicycle or pedestrian facility improvements to view the resulting connected areas and the estimated number of connected people, jobs, services, and other amenities.
