## How does Link determine the connectivity benefit of a project?
On the bicycle side, Link is based on the Level of Traffic Stresss (LTS). LTS is a road classification scheme based on the estimated comfort of bicyclists in the traffic stream. The table below summarizes LTS in terms of the cyclist type that would be comfortable on certain levels and the characteristics of those levels. Generally, as the colors indicate, the higher the LTS, the more dangerous or, the greater the perceived danger, and the more confident the cyclist needs to feel on their bike to consider riding on that type of road. DVRPCâ€™s LTS assignment is based on the number of lanes, effective vehicle speed, and the presence and type of bicycle facility along the road segment. Surveys have shown that the Interested by Concerned group is the largest; therefore, they are often the target audience for bicycle infrastructure planning.
