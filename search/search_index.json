The yellow, or relatively high-stress, segment (LTS 3) is an arterial road with two lanes in each direction. The green, low-stress roads (LTS 1 or 2) are neighborhood streets and are primarily residential.</p> <p></p> <p>Right now, each collection of green streets is an \u201cisland\u201d for people who are only comfortable biking on low stress (LTS 1 or 2) roads or trails. They would not consider biking on the yellow segment, as it would feel unsafe or stressful.</p> <p></p> <p>But if it was possible to convert the yellow LTS 3 segment into an LTS 1 or 2 segment, by building a safer bicycle facility (whether that be a protected bike lane, a roadside trail, or some other measure), all of the neighborhood streets would now be connected via the newly converted low-stress segment. (This is what you're able to do by drawing segments using this tool.)</p> <p></p> <p>By pulling census tract information, it is possible to create an estimate for how many people live in each low stress island. By totaling the number of people in each island, along with the people who actually live along the segment, a high level estimate for the number of people connected via the new segment can be achieved. That is to say, we can estimate how many people were previously on an \"island,\" but could now bike to other segments.</p> <p></p> <p>We can also estimate the number of jobs, transit stations, essential services, or nearby trails that could be connected if this segment was improved.</p> <p></p> <p>Note</p> <p>You may sometimes see a 'blob' shape that extends beyond the street network. LINK folds in certain land uses (e.g., school parking lots, parks, etc..)  in order to more effectively capture proximate uses. So for example, if a school is setback from a high-stress road, LINK will grab both the parking lot and the  school land use and include the school as part of what the new segment connects. </p>"},{"location":"how-it-works/lts/","title":"Level of Traffic Stress (LTS)","text":"<p>On the bicycle side, LINK uses the Level of Traffic Stress (LTS) network. LTS is a road classification scheme based on the estimated comfort of bicyclists in the traffic stream.   Source: NJDOT Technology Transfer, 2021</p> <p>The table below summarizes LTS in terms of the cyclist type that would be comfortable on certain levels and the characteristics of those levels.  Generally, the higher the LTS, the more dangerous or the greater the perceived danger, and the more confident the cyclist needs to feel on their bike to consider riding on that type of road. </p> Level of Traffic Stress (LTS) Comfortable Enough For Characteristics 1 Most People Lowest stress, comfortable for most ages and abilities 2 Interested, but Concerned Suitable for most adults; presents little traffic stress 3 Enthused and Confident Moderate traffic stress; comfortable for those already biking in American cities 4 Strong and Fearless High traffic stress; multilane, fast-moving traffic <p>DVRPC\u2019s LTS assignment is based on the number of lanes, effective vehicle speed, and the presence and type of bicycle facility along the road segment. Surveys have shown that the Interested but Concerned group is the largest; therefore, they are often the target audience for bicycle infrastructure planning.</p> <p>Use your browser's zoom tools or open this table in a new tab by right clicking if it is too small. </p> <p>LINK assumes that any improvements you draw on an LTS 3 or 4 road represent a facility that, if built, would reduce the stress level to a 1 or a 2 (i.e., targeting the Interested, but Concerned group).  So while you might be able to draw a segment on an LTS 4 road and get some information about its connectivity benefit,  if you are planning that segment to be sharrows or a conventional bike lane, you are not reducing the stress level, and therefore not making the connection safer or more viable for all cyclist types. </p> <p>The facility designer and roadway owner are responsible for selecting the safest and least stressful bike facility; LINK does not recommend facility type.</p>"},{"location":"how-it-works/sidewalk/","title":"What about Sidewalks?","text":"<p>The process applied to the LTS network can also be aplied to sidewalks, with some differences.</p> <p>Rather than using LTS, islands on the pedestrian network are simply defined as places with sidewalks and marked crosswalks. </p> <p>This example uses the same street, with only the pedestrian network visible. This location has a series of  sidewalks and a marked crosswalk (on the left-most island, crossing our arterial road).</p> <p></p> <p>Islands are defined as places where there are sidewalks or marked crosswalks that are not connected to other sidewalks or marked crosswalks.</p> <p></p> <p>Census data estimates are collected for each island.</p> <p></p> <p>If a new segment is drawn to connect the two islands on the left, the number of people, jobs, etc... that would be connected can be evaluated. </p> <p></p> <p>In this example, this new segment would connect approximately 180 people. </p> <p></p> <p>The middle segment would connect 580 people. </p> <p></p> <p>This segment would connect 510 people.
